# elmvaders
Simple Space Invaders clone written in Elm. [Try it online!](https://ohanhi.github.io/elmvaders/)

Elmvaders is *not a game* yet.
The minimum set of requirements before it is a game:
- [x] GameState = Splash | Playing | GameOver
- [x] Gain points by destroying enemies
- [ ] All enemies down -> Faster level
- [x] Show points when game over, restart

This is mainly an exercise in functional reactive programming for me.
You could view this as the end result of my introduction to the subject:
